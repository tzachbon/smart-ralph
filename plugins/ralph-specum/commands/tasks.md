# Tasks Phase

You are generating implementation tasks for a specification. Running this command implicitly approves the design phase.

<mandatory>
**YOU ARE A COORDINATOR, NOT A TASK PLANNER.**

You MUST delegate ALL task planning to the `task-planner` subagent.
Do NOT write task breakdowns, verification steps, or tasks.md yourself.
</mandatory>

## Determine Active Spec

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a spec name, use that
2. Otherwise, read `./specs/.current-spec` to get active spec
3. If no active spec, error: "No active spec. Run /ralph-specum:new <name> first."

## Validate

1. Check `./specs/$spec/` directory exists
2. Check `./specs/$spec/design.md` exists. If not, error: "Design not found. Run /ralph-specum:design first."
3. Check `./specs/$spec/requirements.md` exists
4. Read `.ralph-state.json`

## Gather Context

Read:
- `./specs/$spec/requirements.md` (required)
- `./specs/$spec/design.md` (required)
- `./specs/$spec/research.md` (if exists)
- `./specs/$spec/.progress.md`

## Execute Tasks Generation

<mandatory>
Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: task-planner` to generate tasks.
ALL specs MUST follow POC-first workflow.
</mandatory>

Invoke task-planner agent with prompt:

```
You are creating implementation tasks for spec: $spec
Spec path: ./specs/$spec/

Context:
- Requirements: [include requirements.md content]
- Design: [include design.md content]

Your task:
1. Read requirements and design thoroughly
2. Break implementation into POC-first phases:
   - Phase 1: Make It Work (POC) - validate idea, skip tests
   - Phase 2: Refactoring - clean up code
   - Phase 3: Testing - unit, integration, e2e
   - Phase 4: Quality Gates - lint, types, CI
3. Create atomic, autonomous-ready tasks
4. Each task MUST include:
   - **Do**: Exact implementation steps
   - **Files**: Exact file paths to create/modify
   - **Done when**: Explicit success criteria
   - **Verify**: Command to verify completion
   - **Commit**: Conventional commit message
   - _Requirements: references_
   - _Design: references_
5. Count total tasks
6. Output to ./specs/$spec/tasks.md

Use the tasks.md template with frontmatter:
---
spec: $spec
phase: tasks
total_tasks: <count>
created: <timestamp>
---

Critical rules:
- Tasks must be executable without human interaction
- Each task = one commit
- Verify command must be runnable
- POC phase allows shortcuts, later phases clean up
```

## Update State

After tasks complete:

1. Count total tasks from generated file
2. Update `.ralph-state.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "phase": "tasks",
     "totalTasks": <count>,
     ...
   }
   ```

3. Update `.progress.md`:
   - Mark design as implicitly approved
   - Set current phase to tasks
   - Update task count

## Output

```
Tasks phase complete for '$spec'.

Output: ./specs/$spec/tasks.md
Total tasks: <count>

Next: Review tasks.md, then run /ralph-specum:implement to start execution
```
