## Signal Legend

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| OVER | Task/turn complete, no more output |
| ACK | Acknowledged, understood |
| CONTINUE | Work in progress, more to come |
| HOLD | Paused, waiting for input or resource |
| PENDING | Still evaluating; blocking — do not advance until resolved |
| STILL | Still alive/active, no progress but not dead |
| ALIVE | Initial check-in or heartbeat |
| CLOSE | Conversation closing |
| URGENT | Needs immediate attention |
| DEADLOCK | Blocked, cannot proceed |
| INTENT-FAIL | Could not fulfill stated intent |
| SPEC-ADJUSTMENT | Spec criterion cannot be met cleanly; proposing minimal Verify/Done-when amendment |
| SPEC-DEFICIENCY | Spec criterion fundamentally broken; human decision required |

## Message Format

### Header

Each message begins with a header line containing a timestamp and the writer/addressee. The signal itself is placed in the message body as `**Signal**: <SIGNAL>`.

Header format:

### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] <writer> → <addressee>

Example message body (signal in body):

```text
### [2026-04-12 09:00:00] spec-executor → coordinator
**Task**: task-1.1
**Signal**: ALIVE

### [2026-04-12 09:00:01] coordinator → spec-executor
**Task**: task-1.1
**Signal**: ACK

### [2026-04-12 09:01:30] spec-executor → coordinator
**Task**: task-1.1
**Signal**: OVER
```

### Blocking Signals (HOLD, PENDING, URGENT)

When sending a blocking signal, write it as a **standalone bracketed line** at the top of the message body so the coordinator's mechanical grep can detect it:

```text
### [2026-04-12 09:02:00] external-reviewer → spec-executor
[HOLD]
**Task**: task-1.1

The implementation does not match the spec. The verify command fails with exit code 1.
```

The coordinator runs: `grep -c '^\[HOLD\]$\|^\[PENDING\]$\|^\[URGENT\]$' "$SPEC_PATH/chat.md"`
This only matches lines that are exactly `[HOLD]`, `[PENDING]`, or `[URGENT]` — not `**Signal**: HOLD`.
