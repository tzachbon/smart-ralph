## Ralph Spec Workflow

This project uses [Smart Ralph](https://github.com/tzachbon/smart-ralph) for spec-driven development.

### Active Spec

- **Spec**: {{spec_name}}
- **Spec directory**: `{{spec_path}}`
- **Current phase**: Check `.ralph-state.json` in the spec directory

### Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ralph-implement` | Execute the next task from tasks.md |

To execute tasks, invoke the `ralph-implement` skill. It reads the state file, runs one task, and prompts you to re-invoke for the next.

### Spec Artifacts

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `{{spec_path}}/research.md` | Codebase analysis and external research |
| `{{spec_path}}/requirements.md` | User stories, acceptance criteria, FR/NFR |
| `{{spec_path}}/design.md` | Architecture, components, technical decisions |
| `{{spec_path}}/tasks.md` | Ordered task list with Do/Verify/Commit format |
| `{{spec_path}}/.progress.md` | Progress tracking and learnings |
