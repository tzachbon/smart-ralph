# Progress: iterative-failure-recovery

## Original Goal
Add iterative failure recovery to the Ralph execution loop. When task failures occur:
1. Update/fix the tasks that failed
2. Add additional fix tasks if needed
3. Continue iterating until all tasks pass (go green)
4. Keep retrying on failures rather than stopping

## Interview Format

## Current Task
Awaiting next task (3.2 complete)

## Learnings

### Verification: 1.8 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: implement.md recovery components
- Status: PASS
- Commands: grep recoveryMode (0), grep [FIX (0), grep fixTaskMap (0)
- Duration: <5s
- Evidence: All three patterns found in implement.md

### Synthesis Insights (Quick Mode)
- Phase 5 PR Lifecycle already has dynamic task creation pattern for CI failures (implement.md lines 499-511)
- State schema has existing fields for iteration tracking: taskIteration, maxTaskIterations, globalIteration
- Spec-executor outputs structured failure format: `Task X.Y: [name] FAILED\n- Error: ...\n- Attempted fix: ...`
- Extend existing pattern rather than building new mechanism
- Key design decision: Fix task ID format X.Y.N shows relationship to original task
- recoveryMode defaults to false for backwards compatibility
- Max 3 fix tasks per original task prevents infinite loops

### Codebase Patterns Discovered
- Task insertion pattern from Phase 5: read tasks.md, find position, insert, update totalTasks
- State updates use jq for JSON manipulation
- Coordinator outputs TASK_COMPLETE/ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE signals
- Stop-watcher is logging-only, Ralph Loop manages continuation

### Task 2.1: Fix Task Limit Enforcement
- Already implemented in task 1.7 (recovery orchestrator loop)
- Enforcement logic in Section 6c "Check Fix Task Limits" (lines 377-386)
- Checks fixTaskMap[taskId].attempts >= maxFixTasksPerOriginal
- Outputs clear error with fix history (fixTaskIds array)
- Explicitly stops execution without ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE

## Next
Task 3.3: [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: test specs exist

### Task 3.2: Fix Limit Test Spec
- Created specs/test-recovery-limit/ with always-failing task
- Task 1.1 uses `exit 1` / `false` to simulate unfixable error
- State pre-configured with recoveryMode: true, maxFixTasksPerOriginal: 2
- Expected flow: fail -> fix 1.1.1 -> fail -> fix 1.1.2 -> fail -> STOP with error
- Manual verification: run `/ralph-specum:implement --recovery-mode` against this spec
- Success criteria: error message shows "Max fix tasks (2) reached" with fix history

### Task 2.5: Backwards Compatibility
- Added "Backwards Compatibility Note" section at recovery orchestrator entry point
- Explicitly states recoveryMode defaults to false
- Updated Step 1 to clarify that false/undefined/missing all skip recovery
- Pattern "recoveryMode !== true" ensures existing behavior preserved exactly

### Task 2.4: Fix Task Progress Logging
- Added "Fix Task Progress Logging" section after recovery orchestrator Important Notes
- Logs fix task chain to .progress.md under "## Fix Task History" section
- Format: `- Task X.Y: N fixes attempted (fix IDs) - Final: PASS/FAIL`
- Includes logging implementation steps and example progress update
- Also logs FAIL entries when max fix limit is reached

### Task 2.2: fixTaskMap State Tracking
- Added comprehensive jq implementation for fixTaskMap updates in Step 6
- Tracks: attempts count, fixTaskIds array, lastError string
- Includes examples showing state evolution after each fix task
- Also added jq patterns for reading fixTaskMap during limit checks
- totalTasks automatically incremented when fix task is inserted

### Task 3.1: Multi-failure test spec
- Created specs/test-recovery-multi/ with counter-based task
- Task 1.1 reads .counter file, increments, fails if < 3
- Expected flow: fail -> fix 1.1.1 -> fail -> fix 1.1.2 -> pass
- State pre-configured with recoveryMode: true, maxFixTasksPerOriginal: 3
- Manual verification: run `/ralph-specum:implement --recovery-mode` against this spec
