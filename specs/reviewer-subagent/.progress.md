# Progress: reviewer-subagent

## Original Goal

Introduce a reviewer sub-agent concept for the Ralph Specum plugin. The reviewer is a sub-agent that:

1. **Phase Reviews**: After each spec phase (research, requirements, design, tasks) completes, a reviewer sub-agent reviews the output before presenting it to the user. It validates assumptions, ensures grounding, checks adherence to practices, and iterates with the orchestrator until the output meets quality standards.

2. **Execution Reviews**: During task execution, after each task (or group of tasks), the reviewer checks the implementation for hallucinations, correctness, and alignment with specs. If issues are found, the reviewer can:
   - Add new tasks to fix problems
   - Update spec files themselves
   - Iterate with the orchestrator until quality is met

3. **Iteration Loop**: The reviewer iterates with the phase agent/orchestrator until it approves the output with "Looks good, we can continue."

This applies to all phases: research, requirements, design, tasks, and execution.

## Interview Format
- Version: 1.0

## Intent Classification
- Type: GREENFIELD
- Confidence: high (3 keywords matched)
- Min questions: 5
- Max questions: 10
- Keywords matched: introduce, new, concept

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Create spec-reviewer.md agent definition
- [x] 1.2 Add review loop to research.md command (POC integration)
- [x] 2.1 Add review loop to requirements.md command

Awaiting next task



## Learnings
- Synthesis: Plugin uses markdown-only agents with no build step. All changes are markdown files.
- Synthesis: Review insertion point is between phase agent completion and awaitingApproval flag. This is the natural seam in every phase command.
- Synthesis: Subagents cannot spawn other subagents - reviewer MUST be invoked by coordinator (command level), not by phase agent.
- Synthesis: Existing qa-engineer handles command-based verification (VERIFICATION_PASS/FAIL). Reviewer handles conceptual quality review (REVIEW_PASS/FAIL). These are distinct and complementary.
- Synthesis: Stop-hook is Haiku-based (prompt type) and cannot read files. Review logic must live in commands, not hooks.
- Synthesis: Quick mode (plan-synthesizer) currently has no review step. This is where automated review adds most value since there's no human-in-the-loop.
- Synthesis: Max 3 review iterations based on research showing quality plateaus after 2-3 iterations. Graceful degradation prevents blocking.
- Pattern: All phase commands follow identical structure: Validate -> Interview -> Execute -> Walkthrough -> Review -> Update State -> Commit -> Stop
- Pattern: Agent frontmatter must include name, description (with trigger phrases), model: inherit
- Pattern: Version bumps required in BOTH plugin.json AND marketplace.json (currently 3.4.0)
- Agent file convention: frontmatter (name, description with trigger phrases, model: inherit) + Core Philosophy mandatory block + When Invoked + Execution Flow + domain-specific sections + Output Format mandatory block + Communication Style mandatory block

### Verification: 1.3 [VERIFY] POC checkpoint - reviewer agent and research integration
- Status: PASS
- Commands:
  - grep -q "name: spec-reviewer" agents/spec-reviewer.md: PASS (exit 0)
  - grep -q "model: inherit" agents/spec-reviewer.md: PASS (exit 0)
  - grep -q "Artifact Review" commands/research.md: PASS (exit 0)
  - grep -q "iteration" commands/research.md: PASS (exit 0)
- Convention checks:
  - spec-reviewer.md frontmatter matches existing agent convention (name, description with trigger phrases, model: inherit): PASS
  - research.md review loop has required structure (iteration counter, max 3, REVIEW_PASS/FAIL signal parsing, graceful degradation): PASS
  - Review delegation prompt uses subagent_type: spec-reviewer with proper artifact content and iteration tracking: PASS

## Next
Task 2.2 Add review loop to design.md command
