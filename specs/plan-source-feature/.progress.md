# Progress: plan-source-feature

## Goal
Allow users to skip the spec phases and start directly from task execution using their own plan (could be a file or a prompt). The system will automatically generate a full spec without user interaction.

## Status
- [x] Spec created
- [x] Research
- [x] Requirements
- [x] Design
- [x] Tasks (11 total)
- [ ] Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Add --quick flag parsing to start.md - e9a7dd8
- [x] 1.2 Create plan-synthesizer agent - 51567b5
- [x] 1.3 Add Quick Mode Flow to start.md - a862b59
- [x] 1.4 POC Checkpoint - c612a97

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- start.md uses markdown-based command definitions with frontmatter for argument hints
- Agent files follow consistent pattern: frontmatter with name/description/model/tools, then instructions with mandatory constraints and output templates
- Quick mode flow requires 10 steps: validate, infer name, create dir, write state, write progress, update current-spec, invoke synthesizer, update state post-gen, display summary, invoke executor
- POC verified via code review: start.md has complete quick mode flow (lines 26-109), plan-synthesizer has all 4 artifact templates

## Next
Task 2.1 Add full input detection logic
