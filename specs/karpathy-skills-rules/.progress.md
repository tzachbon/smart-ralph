# Progress: karpathy-skills-rules

## Original Goal
Enforce Karpathy-inspired coding rules (Think Before Coding, Simplicity First, Surgical Changes, Goal-Driven Execution) across our skills, agents, and CLAUDE.md. Source: https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills. Rules should be concise but clear to an LLM.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Add Karpathy rules section to CLAUDE.md - f9cc419
- [x] 1.2 Add Karpathy rules to spec-executor agent - f9ec4fc
- [x] 1.3 Add Karpathy rules to task-planner agent - 5d5cae0
- [x] 1.4 Add Karpathy rules to architect-reviewer agent - 73b9f89
- [x] 1.5 Add Karpathy rules to PM, researcher, synthesizer - de1a3c7
- [x] 1.6 Update communication-style and delegation-principle skills - 4492467
- [x] 1.7 Bump plugin version to 3.6.0 - 960897b
- [x] 1.8 POC Checkpoint - 3f19145
- [x] 2.1 Review consistency across all Karpathy sections - e34bd3d
- [x] 3.1 Validate markdown structure of all modified files - (no commit, no fixes needed)
- [x] 4.1 Final content review - (no commit, all criteria pass)
- [x] 4.2 Create PR and verify CI - PR #94 created, CI green

## Current Task
All tasks complete

## Learnings
- All target files are markdown -- no build/test/lint impact
- research-analyst already embodies "Think Before Coding" via "verify-first, assume-never" -- reference, don't duplicate
- All agents use `<mandatory>` tags for enforced rules -- follow same pattern
- Communication Style skill already covers conciseness -- Karpathy Simplicity First complements but shouldn't repeat
- Delegation Principle skill naturally aligns with Surgical Changes -- brief reinforcement sufficient
- Current plugin version is 3.5.1, bump to 3.6.0 (minor: new behavioral feature)
- Agent files place Communication Style section near end -- insert Karpathy Rules before it
- tasks.md total_tasks corrected from 13 to 12 (actual checkbox count)
- All 9 files passed consistency review: agents use `## Karpathy Rules` + `<mandatory>`, CLAUDE.md uses `## Karpathy Coding Rules` (no mandatory), skills use `## Karpathy Alignment` (no mandatory). No duplication with existing content found.
- Markdown structure validation: all code blocks balanced, all `<mandatory>` tags paired, all frontmatter intact, both JSON files valid. No fixes needed.
- Final content review: all 13 acceptance criteria from requirements.md confirmed (AC-1.1 through AC-4.2, NFR-1 through NFR-3). No fixes needed.

## Artifact Reviews

### Review: research.md (Iteration 1)
- Status: REVIEW_PASS
- Findings: Brief and focused. Source table maps rules to audiences. Feasibility assessment is clear. Quality commands correctly marked N/A for markdown-only changes.
- Action: proceeded

### Review: requirements.md (Iteration 1)
- Status: REVIEW_PASS
- Findings: 4 user stories cover all change categories. ACs are specific and testable. FR table traces to user stories. NFRs address conciseness and consistency.
- Action: proceeded

### Review: design.md (Iteration 1)
- Status: REVIEW_PASS
- Findings: Architecture diagram shows enforcement hierarchy. Per-agent templates are complete and tailored. Technical decisions table justifies placement and format choices. File structure lists all 11 files.
- Action: proceeded

### Review: tasks.md (Iteration 1)
- Status: REVIEW_FAIL
- Findings: total_tasks frontmatter said 13 but actual checkboxes counted to 12.
- Action: revision applied (fixed total_tasks to 12)

### Review: tasks.md (Iteration 2)
- Status: REVIEW_PASS
- Findings: 12 tasks confirmed. All tasks have Do/Files/Done when/Verify/Commit. Traceability to requirements and design present. POC-first structure followed.
- Action: proceeded
