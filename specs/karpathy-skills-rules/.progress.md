# Progress: karpathy-skills-rules

## Original Goal
Enforce Karpathy-inspired coding rules (Think Before Coding, Simplicity First, Surgical Changes, Goal-Driven Execution) across our skills, agents, and CLAUDE.md. Source: https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills. Rules should be concise but clear to an LLM.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Add Karpathy rules section to CLAUDE.md - f9cc419
- [x] 1.2 Add Karpathy rules to spec-executor agent - f9ec4fc
- [x] 1.3 Add Karpathy rules to task-planner agent - 5d5cae0

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- All target files are markdown -- no build/test/lint impact
- research-analyst already embodies "Think Before Coding" via "verify-first, assume-never" -- reference, don't duplicate
- All agents use `<mandatory>` tags for enforced rules -- follow same pattern
- Communication Style skill already covers conciseness -- Karpathy Simplicity First complements but shouldn't repeat
- Delegation Principle skill naturally aligns with Surgical Changes -- brief reinforcement sufficient
- Current plugin version is 3.5.1, bump to 3.6.0 (minor: new behavioral feature)
- Agent files place Communication Style section near end -- insert Karpathy Rules before it
- tasks.md total_tasks corrected from 13 to 12 (actual checkbox count)

## Artifact Reviews

### Review: research.md (Iteration 1)
- Status: REVIEW_PASS
- Findings: Brief and focused. Source table maps rules to audiences. Feasibility assessment is clear. Quality commands correctly marked N/A for markdown-only changes.
- Action: proceeded

### Review: requirements.md (Iteration 1)
- Status: REVIEW_PASS
- Findings: 4 user stories cover all change categories. ACs are specific and testable. FR table traces to user stories. NFRs address conciseness and consistency.
- Action: proceeded

### Review: design.md (Iteration 1)
- Status: REVIEW_PASS
- Findings: Architecture diagram shows enforcement hierarchy. Per-agent templates are complete and tailored. Technical decisions table justifies placement and format choices. File structure lists all 11 files.
- Action: proceeded

### Review: tasks.md (Iteration 1)
- Status: REVIEW_FAIL
- Findings: total_tasks frontmatter said 13 but actual checkboxes counted to 12.
- Action: revision applied (fixed total_tasks to 12)

### Review: tasks.md (Iteration 2)
- Status: REVIEW_PASS
- Findings: 12 tasks confirmed. All tasks have Do/Files/Done when/Verify/Commit. Traceability to requirements and design present. POC-first structure followed.
- Action: proceeded
