# Progress: add-skills-doc

## Original Goal

Add SKILLS documentation to the ralph-specum plugin so Claude Code knows when to use the commands. The plugin currently has commands (start, new, research, requirements, design, tasks, implement, status, switch, cancel, help) but no skills/ folder with SKILL.md files to help Claude decide when to invoke them.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 Create skills directory structure
- [x] 1.2 Create SKILL.md with all command mappings
- [x] 1.X POC Checkpoint
- [x] 2.1 Review and polish descriptions
- [x] 4.1 Pushed to main (e7e9aa6)
