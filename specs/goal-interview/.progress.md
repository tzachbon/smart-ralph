# Progress: goal-interview

## Original Goal

Implement exhaustive user interviews during the research phase using the AskUserQuestion tool. The feature should ask non-obvious questions about technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs and continue iteratively until requirements are fully understood before writing specifications.

Additional Requirement: Remove the "tools" field from commands or agents definitions (use allowed-tools in commands instead).

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 Remove tools field from research-analyst.md - 7fef4a2
- [x] 1.2 Remove tools field from remaining 4 agents - f2dd0a8
- [x] 1.3 Quality Checkpoint - no commit (all verified)
- [x] 1.4 Add goal interview to start.md (pre-research) - 289f86a
- [x] 1.5 Add interview to research.md - c224370
- [x] 1.6 Add interview to requirements.md - fec0db9
- [x] 1.7 Quality Checkpoint - no commit (all verified)

## Learnings

- AskUserQuestion tool is available in Claude Code v2.0.21+ and supports 1-4 questions with 2-4 options each
- AskUserQuestion has a 60-second timeout per call
- AskUserQuestion is NOT available in subagents spawned via Task tool (critical constraint)
- The "tools" field in agent frontmatter is deprecated/redundant; commands use "allowed-tools"
- Requirements elicitation best practices emphasize "what if" scenarios, meta-questions, and iterative probing
- KJ method provides systematic approach: open-ended probing questions -> affinitization -> Kano analysis
- Key elicitation questions: "What assumptions am I making?", "What if X happens?", "What other questions should I ask?"
- Interview convergence requires iterative cycles until requirements stabilize
- User decision: interview results stored in phase artifacts (research.md, etc.), not separate files
- User decision: adaptive depth starts minimal, expands on complexity indicators
- User decision: quick mode skips ALL interviews, no partial bypass option
- Architecture: interviews MUST happen in commands before Task delegation, context passed to agents
- 5 agent files have "tools" field (research-analyst, product-manager, architect-reviewer, task-planner, plan-synthesizer)
- 4 command files need interview logic (research, requirements, design, tasks)
- Design: questions defined inline in each command file, not separate template (user preference)
- Design: "Other" selection is deterministic trigger for follow-up questions
- Design: max 5 follow-up rounds to prevent interview fatigue
- Design: each phase artifact gets dedicated section (User Context, User Decisions, Design Inputs, Execution Context)
- Pattern: existing AskUserQuestion usage in new.md and start.md provides reference implementation
- Pattern: --quick flag checked anywhere in $ARGUMENTS, full skip of all interactive elements
- Pattern: coordinator commands delegate ALL substantive work, only handle validation/state/coordination
- Task planning: agent tools removal should happen first (simpler, independent tasks)
- Task planning: command modifications are interdependent on same interview pattern
- Task planning: 13 total tasks (5 agent cleanup, 4 command interviews, quality checkpoints, version bump, PR)
- Task planning: no refactoring phase needed since changes are markdown-only
- Task planning: manual testing only per user preference, no E2E scripts
- Risk: interview section placement must be BEFORE Task delegation in each command
- Risk: frontmatter line numbers may shift if agent files were modified elsewhere
- qa-engineer.md also had tools field, removed to satisfy verify command that checks all agent files
- Goal interview in start.md uses 3 questions: problem type, constraints, success criteria
- Goal interview stores responses in .progress.md under "Goal Context" section
- Goal interview context passed to research-analyst to focus research areas

## Blockers
