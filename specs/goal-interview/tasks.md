# Tasks: Goal Interview

## Phase 1: Make It Work (POC)

Focus: Add interview logic to start.md (goal clarification) and 4 phase commands. Remove tools field from 5 agents. All 10 files modified in POC phase per user decision.

- [x] 1.1 Remove tools field from research-analyst.md

  - **Verify**: `grep -n "^tools:" plugins/ralph-specum/agents/research-analyst.md` returns nothing
  - **Commit**: `refactor(agents): remove deprecated tools field from research-analyst`
  - _Requirements: FR-14, AC-6.1_
  - _Design: Agent File Cleanup_

- [x] 1.2 Remove tools field from remaining 4 agents
  - **Do**: Delete tools line from frontmatter in each file:
    - product-manager.md line 5: `tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, Task]`
    - architect-reviewer.md line 5: `tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, Task]`
    - task-planner.md line 5: `tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Task]`

    - `plugins/ralph-specum/agents/plan-synthesizer.md`
  - **Done when**: No agent file contains `tools:` line in frontmatter
  - **Verify**: `grep -rn "^tools:" plugins/ralph-specum/agents/` returns nothing
  - **Commit**: `refactor(agents): remove deprecated tools field from all agents`
  - _Requirements: FR-15, FR-16, FR-17, FR-18, AC-6.2, AC-6.3, AC-6.4, AC-6.5_

  - **Verify**: All commands must pass:
    - Check frontmatter: `head -6 plugins/ralph-specum/agents/*.md` shows name/description/model only
    - No tools field: `grep -rn "^tools:" plugins/ralph-specum/agents/` returns empty
  - **Done when**: All agent frontmatters valid, no tools field present
  - **Commit**: `chore(agents): pass quality checkpoint` (only if fixes needed)

- [x] 1.4 Add goal interview to start.md (pre-research)
  - **Do**:
    1. start.md already has AskUserQuestion in allowed-tools (line 5)

  - **Commit**: `chore(plugin): bump version to 1.2.0 for goal interview feature`

- [ ] 4.2 Create PR and verify CI
  - **Do**:
    1. Verify current branch is feat/goal-interview: `git branch --show-current`
    2. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
    3. Push branch: `git push -u origin feat/goal-interview`
    4. Create PR: `gh pr create --title "feat: add goal interview to phase commands" --body "Add user interviews using AskUserQuestion before each phase delegation. Includes quick mode bypass and removes deprecated tools field from agents."`
  - **Verify**: `gh pr checks --watch` all green
  - **Done when**: PR created, CI passes, ready for review
  - **If CI fails**: Read failure, fix locally, push, re-verify

## Notes

- **POC shortcuts taken**: None needed, changes are simple markdown additions
- **Production TODOs**: None, feature is complete after POC
- **Files modified**: 10 total (5 commands + 5 agents)
- **Testing approach**: Manual only per user decision
