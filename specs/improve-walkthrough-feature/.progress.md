# Progress: improve-walkthrough-feature

## Original Goal

I find myself too many times after each phase asking to make me a walkthrough of the generated file. Although we added the walkthrough feature it doesn't do as I expect it to. How can we improve it?

## Intent Classification

**Type**: Add (enhance existing feature)
**Complexity**: MID_SIZED
**Questions**: 3-5 questions per phase

## Current Phase

## Learnings

- No walkthrough feature currently exists - only mentioned as future suggestion in SPECKIT-REVIEW.md
- Phase commands have minimal output: just "Output: ./specs/$spec/file.md" with no summary
- All 4 phase commands follow same pattern with `## Output` section at end
- Commands are markdown prompts, not code - walkthroughs must be added as text instructions
- Agents handle generation, commands handle presentation - walkthrough belongs in commands
- Templates provide consistent structure for each artifact type
- Research walkthrough template includes: Summary, Feasibility/Risk/Effort metrics, Key Recommendations, Related Specs, Review Focus
- Tasks walkthrough template includes: Total tasks, Phase breakdown table, POC checkpoint marker, Estimated commits, Review focus

### Verification: 1.5 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: verify all 4 commands modified
- Status: PASS
- Command: `grep -l "Walkthrough" plugins/ralph-specum/commands/*.md | wc -l` returned 4
- Files verified:
  - research.md: Contains "Display Walkthrough" and "## Walkthrough" sections
  - requirements.md: Contains "Display Walkthrough" and "## Walkthrough" sections
  - design.md: Contains "Display Walkthrough" and "## Walkthrough" sections
  - tasks.md: Contains "Display Walkthrough" and "## Walkthrough" sections
- All 4 command files have walkthrough sections properly implemented

### POC Checkpoint: 1.6 - Code verification complete
- Status: PASS
- Verified all 4 command files have proper walkthrough implementations:

**research.md (lines 683-732)**:
- Extracts: Executive Summary, Feasibility Assessment (feasibility/risk/effort), Key Recommendations, Related Specs
- Displays: Summary, metrics table, numbered recommendations, related specs list, review focus
- Error handling included

**requirements.md (lines 284-332)**:
- Extracts: Goal Summary, User Stories (count + table), FRs by priority, NFRs
- Displays: Goal, user story table with ACs, requirement counts by priority, review focus
- Error handling included

**design.md (lines 291-345)**:
- Extracts: Overview Summary, Components list, Technical Decisions table, File Structure counts
- Displays: Overview, component table, decisions table, file change counts, review focus
- Error handling included

**tasks.md (lines 303-353)**:
- Extracts: Total tasks from frontmatter, phase breakdown counts, POC checkpoint marker, commit estimate
- Displays: Total tasks, phase breakdown table, POC completion marker, estimated commits, review focus
- Error handling included

All walkthroughs follow consistent pattern:
1. Phase completion message + output path
2. `## Walkthrough` header
3. Key metrics/summary
4. Detailed breakdown tables
5. Review focus section
6. Next step instruction
7. Error handling for missing data

## Next

Task 2.1: Standardize walkthrough header format
