# Progress: improve-walkthrough-feature

## Original Goal

I find myself too many times after each phase asking to make me a walkthrough of the generated file. Although we added the walkthrough feature it doesn't do as I expect it to. How can we improve it?

## Intent Classification

**Type**: Add (enhance existing feature)
**Complexity**: MID_SIZED
**Questions**: 3-5 questions per phase

## Current Phase

## Phase History

| Phase | Status | Timestamp |

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 Add walkthrough to research.md command

## Current Task

Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- No walkthrough feature currently exists - only mentioned as future suggestion in SPECKIT-REVIEW.md
- Phase commands have minimal output: just "Output: ./specs/$spec/file.md" with no summary
- All 4 phase commands follow same pattern with `## Output` section at end
- Commands are markdown prompts, not code - walkthroughs must be added as text instructions
- Agents handle generation, commands handle presentation - walkthrough belongs in commands
- Templates provide consistent structure for each artifact type
- Research walkthrough template includes: Summary, Feasibility/Risk/Effort metrics, Key Recommendations, Related Specs, Review Focus
- Tasks walkthrough template includes: Total tasks, Phase breakdown table, POC checkpoint marker, Estimated commits, Review focus

## Next

Task 1.5: [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: verify all 4 commands modified
