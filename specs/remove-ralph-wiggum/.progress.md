# Progress: remove-ralph-wiggum

## Completed Tasks

(none yet)

## Current Task

Awaiting execution start

## Learnings

### Synthesis Insights (Quick Mode)

- Current stop-watcher.sh already reads state with jq, validates JSON - just needs loop control output added
- implement.md is 1255 lines - most is coordinator prompt, which can be reused in stop-hook
- cancel.md skill invocation is single line, trivial to remove
- Path resolver already sourced in stop-watcher - spec path resolution works
- Two existing CI workflows: version check and spec file check - can use as template for bats
- No existing bats tests - starting fresh with test infrastructure

### Codebase Patterns Found

- Hook output format: scripts output to stdout, errors to stderr
- State file location: `$CWD/$SPEC_PATH/.ralph-state.json` (resolved path)
- Settings check: YAML frontmatter parsing with sed/awk
- jq guards: `command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 0`

### Scope Decisions

- Keeping state file schema unchanged (no breaking state changes)
- Coordinator prompt will be extracted/templated in Phase 2, not POC
- Recovery mode preserved (existing in state schema)
- .progress.md preserved by cancel (history value) - spec directory still removed

## Next

Task 1.1: Add loop control logic to stop-watcher.sh
