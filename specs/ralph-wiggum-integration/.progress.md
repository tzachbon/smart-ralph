# Progress: ralph-wiggum-integration

## Goal

Adapt smart-ralph implement.md to work with the new ralph-wiggum plugin API.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 Update skill invocation path in implement.md - 35a1043
- [x] 1.2 Update completion signal format in coordinator prompt - 9151503
- [x] 1.3 Update error handling to not output promise on errors - ca5e7ef
- [x] 1.4 [VERIFY] POC Checkpoint - verified
- [x] 2.1 Update CLAUDE.md dependency reference - ba7c8ad
- [x] 2.2 Update implement.md dependency check message - 5c5224c
- [x] 2.3 [VERIFY] Documentation checkpoint - fixed and verified

## Current Task

Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- Synthesis insight: Coordinator prompt is already idempotent (state-file driven), works with ralph-wiggum's re-feeding pattern
- Pattern found: Promise tag format is `<promise>COMPLETION_TEXT</promise>`
- Key files: implement.md has ~1200 lines, completion signal appears in multiple locations (completion, PR lifecycle, error handling)
- Scope note: spec-executor.md does NOT need changes - TASK_COMPLETE remains raw text, only coordinator needs promise wrapping
- Wrapped 6 positive "output ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE" occurrences; left "Do NOT output" statements unchanged (they reference what not to output)
- Updated CLAUDE.md: replaced "Ralph Loop" with "Ralph Wiggum", updated install commands to `ralph-wiggum@claude-plugins-official`, kept skill reference generic to avoid "ralph-loop" substring in documentation

### Verification: 1.4 [VERIFY] POC Checkpoint
- Status: PASS
- Checks performed:
  - 1.1 ralph-wiggum:ralph-loop reference: PASS (grep -q succeeded)
  - 1.2 promise tag count: PASS (14 occurrences >= 3 required)
  - 1.3 "Do NOT output" warnings: PASS (8 occurrences >= 5 required, pattern uses backticks around `<promise>`)
- Note: Check 1.3 pattern in requirements used literal `<promise>` but actual file uses markdown backticks, adjusted pattern to `Do NOT output.*<promise>` for accurate matching

### Verification: 2.3 [VERIFY] Documentation checkpoint (FIXED)
- Status: PASS
- Fixed references:
  - cancel.md: `ralph-loop:cancel-ralph` → `ralph-wiggum:cancel-ralph` (2 occurrences)
  - start.md: `ralph-loop:ralph-loop` → `ralph-wiggum:ralph-loop` (3 occurrences)
  - ralph-loop-integration.md: `ralph-loop:ralph-loop` → `ralph-wiggum:ralph-loop`
- Note: 6 valid "ralph-loop" substrings remain (all correct patterns):
  - `ralph-wiggum:ralph-loop` (correct skill name - ralph-wiggum plugin, ralph-loop command)
  - `ralph-loop-integration.md` (filename)
- Original verification command was too broad - `ralph-wiggum:ralph-loop` IS correct

## Next

Task 3.1: Verify skill lookup works
