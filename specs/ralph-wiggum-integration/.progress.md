# Progress: ralph-wiggum-integration

## Goal

Adapt smart-ralph implement.md to work with the new ralph-wiggum plugin API.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 Update skill invocation path in implement.md - 35a1043
- [x] 1.2 Update completion signal format in coordinator prompt - 9151503
- [x] 1.3 Update error handling to not output promise on errors - ca5e7ef

## Current Task

Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- Synthesis insight: Coordinator prompt is already idempotent (state-file driven), works with ralph-wiggum's re-feeding pattern
- Pattern found: Promise tag format is `<promise>COMPLETION_TEXT</promise>`
- Key files: implement.md has ~1200 lines, completion signal appears in multiple locations (completion, PR lifecycle, error handling)
- Scope note: spec-executor.md does NOT need changes - TASK_COMPLETE remains raw text, only coordinator needs promise wrapping
- Wrapped 6 positive "output ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE" occurrences; left "Do NOT output" statements unchanged (they reference what not to output)

## Next

Task 1.4: [VERIFY] POC Checkpoint
