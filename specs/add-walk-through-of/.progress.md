# Progress: add-walk-through-of

## Original Goal
Let's add a walk through of changes after each phase, something that will be easy to read as the developer, that if I want to deep dive I will just go to the files themselves.

## Status
- Phase: execution
- Started: Quick mode artifact generation
- All spec artifacts generated

## Completed
- research.md - Feasibility analysis complete
- requirements.md - User stories and ACs defined
- design.md - Architecture and integration points specified
- tasks.md - 14 tasks across 5 phases
- [x] 1.1 Update progress.md template with walkthrough section

## Learnings
- Quick mode enabled - all artifacts auto-generated
- Integration points: 4 agents + 1 template
- Pattern: Each agent gets identical walkthrough section
- Git diff provides accurate change detection
- .progress.md is the central storage for walkthroughs
- Communication style requires tables/bullets over prose

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Next
Task 1.2 - Add walkthrough generation to research-analyst
