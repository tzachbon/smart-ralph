## Interview Responses

### Goal Interview (from start.md)
- Problem: Organize specs by project/area - want to group related specs in subdirectories
- Constraints: Backward compatible (existing ./specs/ root behavior must still work), Config-driven paths (paths defined in config file), Auto-discovery (automatically find specs in nested directories)
- Success criteria:
  - Can run /ralph-specum:status and see all specs across dirs
  - Can /ralph-specum:start from any subdir
  - /ralph-specum:switch lists specs from all locations
  - Can use --specs-dir flag to specify specs directory
- Config location: Both config file AND CLI flag (config file for defaults, CLI flag to override)

### Requirements Interview (from requirements.md)
- Primary users: End users of ralph-specum (developers using the plugin for spec-driven development)
- Priority tradeoffs: Backward compatibility first - ensure existing ./specs/ behavior never breaks
- Success criteria: All commands work with any configured specs dir; Zero breaking changes for existing users; No migration needed - old behavior works, but easy to create new specs in new places
- Current-spec management: Need to consider how to manage .current-spec with multiple specs dirs

### Requirements Review (from requirements.md)
- User stories approval: Yes, complete
- Acceptance criteria approval: Yes, clear
- Priorities approval: Yes, appropriate
- Requirements feedback: Approved, let's proceed

### Design Interview (from design.md)
- Architecture style: Extend existing architecture - build on current settings/commands/hooks patterns
- Technology constraints: No constraints - use what we are using today
- Integration approach: Use existing APIs and interfaces - extend current settings file, hook patterns

### Tasks Interview (from tasks.md)
- Testing depth: Standard - unit + integration (test resolver functions and command integration)
- Deployment approach: Standard CI/CD pipeline (no special rollout needed, just merge)
- Execution priority: Balanced - reasonable quality with speed

### Tasks Review (from tasks.md)
- Task coverage: Yes, comprehensive
- Task phases: Yes, good structure
- Verification steps: Yes, clear
- Tasks feedback: Approved, let's proceed

## Learnings

### Research Phase Discoveries
- **basePath already exists in state** - `.ralph-state.json` stores full path (`./specs/$name`), so commands already support dynamic paths. Only need to fix spec creation and discovery.
- **170+ hardcoded refs** - Found refs to `./specs/` across 12 commands, 8 agents, 2 hooks, plus templates and skills.
- **Settings pattern exists** - `.claude/ralph-specum.local.md` already supports frontmatter config. Can add `specs_dirs` array there.
- **Hooks already read settings** - Both shell hooks parse settings file, so extending to read `specs_dirs` is straightforward.
- **Industry standard precedence** - CLI flag > env var > project config > defaults. This matches user's requirement for --specs-dir flag override.
- **Glob patterns common** - npm/pnpm/Knip all use glob patterns (`packages/*`) for workspace discovery.
- **.current-spec limitation** - Currently stores bare name. Need to store full path for multi-root support (backward compat: bare name implies `./specs/`).

### Requirements Phase Discoveries
- **6 user stories identified** - Config, creation, viewing, switching, backward compat, and auto-discovery cover all user needs.
- **11 functional requirements** - Prioritized by risk: path resolver and backward compat are High priority.
- **Explicit paths over globs** - Decided against glob patterns (`packages/*/specs`) to reduce complexity and improve performance. Users list dirs explicitly.
- **Disambiguation approach** - Duplicate spec names allowed; switch command prompts user to select with full path display.
- **No deep recursion** - Only direct children of specs_dirs are discovered. Prevents performance issues and unexpected behavior.
- **Shell portability concern** - Path resolver helper must use POSIX-compliant features only for cross-platform support.

### Design Phase Discoveries
- **path-resolver.sh as single source of truth** - All hooks/commands source this script. 5 core functions: `ralph_get_specs_dirs()`, `ralph_find_spec()`, `ralph_list_specs()`, `ralph_resolve_current()`, `ralph_get_default_dir()`.
- **Backward compat via .current-spec interpretation** - Bare name = `./specs/$name`, full path = as-is. No migration needed.
- **Disambiguation returns exit code 2** - Distinguishes "not found" (exit 1) from "ambiguous" (exit 2) for proper handling.
- **Commands follow consistent pattern** - Replace hardcoded `./specs/` with `source path-resolver.sh` then use resolver functions.
- **Agents receive dynamic paths via delegation prompts** - No hardcoded paths in agents; spec path comes from Task delegation context.
- **Settings parsing uses sed/awk pattern** - Matches existing hook patterns; parses YAML frontmatter for `specs_dirs` array.

### Task Planning Discoveries
- **32 tasks total** - Organized across 5 phases: POC (17 tasks), Refactoring (5 tasks), Testing (4 tasks), Quality Gates (2 tasks), PR Lifecycle (4 tasks).
- **Quality checkpoints every 2-3 tasks** - Inserted at 1.4, 1.8, 1.12, 1.15, 2.3, 3.3 for early error detection.
- **No build/lint/test commands** - This is a markdown-based plugin, so shell syntax validation (`bash -n`) is the primary verification.
- **POC validation via sourcing** - Can validate path-resolver.sh works by sourcing and calling functions directly.
- **Version bump planned** - 2.11.1 -> 2.12.0 (minor version for new feature).
- **Test scripts as validation** - Creating `test-path-resolver.sh` and `test-multi-dir-integration.sh` for automated verification.

### Execution Phase Learnings
- **path-resolver.sh created** - Implemented 5 core functions: `ralph_get_specs_dirs()`, `ralph_get_default_dir()`, `ralph_resolve_current()`, `ralph_find_spec()`, `ralph_list_specs()`. All follow design spec exactly.
- **settings-template.md updated** - Added specs_dirs to frontmatter with default `["./specs"]`, documentation section, and monorepo example showing multi-package setup.
- **load-spec-context.sh updated** - Sources path-resolver.sh, uses `ralph_resolve_current()` for spec resolution instead of hardcoded `./specs/` paths. Extracts SPEC_NAME from resolved path basename.
