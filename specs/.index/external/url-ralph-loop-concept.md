## Summary
Ralph represents a fundamental shift from traditional vertical software development toward an iterative, autonomous approach. Rather than building "brick by brick like Jenga," developers program loops that accomplish specific objectives repeatedly.

## Key Sections

### How It Works
The pattern operates as a monolithic orchestrator that:
- Allocates specifications for required capabilities
- Assigns a goal to the system
- Repeats execution cycles focused on single tasks per iteration

"Ralph is monolithic. Ralph works autonomously in a single repository as a single process that performs one task per loop."

### Key Characteristics
- **Mindset Shift**: Transcends autonomous forward development or clean-room reverse engineering—philosophical approach recognizing LLMs as programmable computers
- **Manual & Automated Modes**: Manual prompting or automated execution with pause points (CTRL+C progression)
- **Observational Learning**: Developers must actively monitor loop execution to identify failure domains

### Integration Pattern
Centers on context engineering as a universal technique applicable across all task types, functioning as infrastructure for evolutionary software development.

### Primary Use Case
Geoffrey Huntley demonstrates applying Ralph under nested loops for automated system verification, issue detection, code fixing, deployment, and validation—without human intervention.
