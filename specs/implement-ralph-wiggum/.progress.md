# Progress: implement-ralph-wiggum

## Goal
Make the /implement command run the original Ralph Wiggum official plugin instead of the current spec-executor approach.

## Status
Phase: execution
Started: 2026-01-16

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Delete custom stop-handler files - cdc5416
- [x] 1.2 Create minimal implement.md wrapper with dependency check - 03844b8
- [x] 1.3 Add coordinator prompt with basic task reading - 88daaa3
- [x] 1.4 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: syntax validation - PASS
- [x] 1.5 Add state update logic to coordinator - db13337
- [x] 1.6 Add parallel [P] task support to coordinator - eedff89

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Next
Task 1.7: Add [VERIFY] task delegation to coordinator

## Context
Integrate or replace the current spec-executor with the official Ralph Wiggum plugin for task execution during the /implement phase.

## Learnings

### Codebase Research Phase
- implement.md is a COORDINATOR, NOT an implementer. Must delegate via Task tool.
- spec-executor agent handles individual task execution autonomously
- stop-handler.sh manages the task loop via Claude Code's Stop hook
- 4 verification layers in stop-handler: contradiction detection, uncommitted files, checkmark verification, signal verification
- State file (.ralph-state.json) is read-only for executor, modified only by stop-handler and commands
- TASK_COMPLETE is the only valid completion signal
- Parallel execution uses isolated .progress-task-N.md temp files, merged after batch
- [VERIFY] tasks delegate to qa-engineer agent
- [P] marker enables parallel execution for consecutive tasks
- Checkmark count in tasks.md verified against taskIndex to detect state manipulation
- No traditional quality commands (lint, test, build). Plugin is markdown-only.
- CI only checks plugin version bumps on PR
- Related specs: parallel-task-execution (HIGH), qa-verification (HIGH) may need updates

### Related Specs Analysis (2026-01-16)
- **parallel-task-execution**: 900+ lines in implement.md for [P] marker parallelism. Uses Task tool multi-call pattern. Will need complete redesign or deprecation if switching to Ralph Wiggum (single-context model).
- **qa-verification**: [VERIFY] task delegation from spec-executor to qa-engineer via Task tool. If spec-executor removed, this delegation pattern breaks. Need alternative approach.
- **goal-interview**: Interviews in commands (not implement). Independent of execution method. No changes needed.
- **plan-source-feature**: Generates tasks, does not execute. Upstream and independent. No changes needed.
- **add-skills-doc**: Documentation only. No impact.

### Ralph Wiggum Architecture Findings
- Ralph Wiggum uses `/ralph-loop` command with `--completion-promise` and `--max-iterations`
- Stop hook intercepts exits and re-prompts with same prompt (not Task tool delegation)
- File-based persistence via git history, not state JSON
- No built-in parallel execution support
- Completion via exact string match on completion-promise, not TASK_COMPLETE signal
- Single-context model (no subagent spawning mid-loop)

### Clarified Architecture (User Feedback Round 2)
- `/implement` becomes THIN WRAPPER that just calls `/ralph-loop`
- Current implement.md coordinator logic MOVES INTO the ralph-loop prompt
- The prompt tells Claude: read state, parse tasks, invoke spec-executor via Task, handle parallel, output completion
- Ralph Wiggum stop-hook re-injects the prompt each iteration
- spec-executor, parallel [P], [VERIFY] delegation all preserved (they're in the prompt)
- Delete custom stop-handler.sh and hooks/hooks.json (Ralph Wiggum provides loop)

### Dependency & Breaking Changes (User Feedback Round 3)
- Users must install Ralph Wiggum plugin separately: `/plugin install ralph-wiggum@claude-plugins-official`
- This is a BREAKING CHANGE - acceptable, just document it
- Remove most/all custom stop-handler.sh logic (delegate heavy lifting to Ralph Wiggum)
- Maybe keep minimal hook to complement Ralph Wiggum (e.g., cleanup on cancel)
- Verification logic moves into the prompt (Claude checks before completion signal)

### External Research Findings (2026-01-16)
- Official plugin at `anthropics/claude-code/plugins/ralph-wiggum/`
- Install via `/plugin install ralph-wiggum@claude-plugins-official`
- Commands: `/ralph-loop "prompt" --max-iterations N --completion-promise "TEXT"` and `/cancel-ralph`
- Stop hook uses exit code 2 to block Claude exit and re-inject same prompt
- State file: `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md` with YAML frontmatter (active, iteration, max_iterations, completion_promise, started_at)
- Hook receives JSON via stdin: session_id, transcript_path (JSONL), cwd, hook_event_name, stop_hook_active
- Known bug: plugin-installed hooks with exit code 2 may halt instead of continue
- Completion-promise uses exact string match (unreliable for variations)
- No parallel execution support (single-context model)
- Token consumption: accumulating context, $50-100+ for large codebases
- Relies on git history + progress files for state, not structured JSON

### Requirements Phase Insights (2026-01-16)
- Key architectural decision: implement.md becomes thin wrapper (~100 lines vs ~1000 current)
- Coordinator logic moves INTO ralph-loop prompt, not into a separate file
- Two state files will coexist: .ralph-state.json (task tracking) and .claude/ralph-loop.local.md (iteration tracking)
- Verification logic (4 layers in stop-handler.sh) must move into coordinator prompt
- Cancel command needs dual cleanup: both /cancel-ralph and .ralph-state.json deletion
- Completion signal translation: spec-executor outputs TASK_COMPLETE, coordinator outputs ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE
- Breaking change documentation required: README, error messages, migration guide
- spec-executor.md and qa-engineer.md remain unchanged (Task tool delegation preserved)

### Design Phase Insights (2026-01-16)
- implement.md will be ~80 lines wrapper + ~700 lines inline coordinator prompt (~780 total, down from 1027)
- Dependency detection via Skill tool invocation attempt, not file path checking
- Max iterations calculation: totalTasks * maxTaskIterations * 2 (buffer for retries)
- ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE is distinct completion signal for loop termination (vs TASK_COMPLETE for individual tasks)
- Single [P] task optimization: treated as sequential to avoid temp file overhead
- State file schema remains unchanged for backward compatibility
- No automated tests possible (markdown-only plugin), manual verification checklist defined
- Verification logic migration: 4 layers from stop-handler.sh move into coordinator prompt section
- Cancel command modification minimal: add /cancel-ralph call, keep existing .ralph-state.json cleanup

### Task Planning Insights (2026-01-16)
- POC-first: Tasks 1.1-1.12 focus on getting /ralph-loop working before cleanup
- Delete stop-handler FIRST (task 1.1) to avoid conflicts with Ralph Wiggum's stop-hook
- Coordinator prompt built incrementally: basic delegation (1.3) -> state (1.5) -> parallel (1.6) -> verify (1.7) -> verification layers (1.9)
- Quality checkpoints at 1.4, 1.8, 1.11 catch issues early
- Version bump (2.4) placed in Phase 2 after POC validates the approach works
- README update (2.5) documents breaking change before PR
- All verification commands are grep/test based (no runtime execution of markdown plugin)
- PR creation (4.4) is final task with full description and test plan

### Verification: 1.4 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: syntax validation
- Status: PASS
- Command: frontmatter grep check exited 0
- Findings:
  - Valid YAML frontmatter (lines 1-5) with opening/closing `---`
  - Proper header hierarchy: # level at line 7, ## level at lines 11, 18, 23, 29, 33, 50, 59, 169
  - All code blocks properly closed
  - 183 lines total, well structured
  - No broken or incomplete sections
