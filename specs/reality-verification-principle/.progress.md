## Current Task

All tasks complete

## Learnings

- Quick mode synthesis from plan file
- 5 files to modify: SKILL.md (create), plan-synthesizer.md, task-planner.md, qa-engineer.md, templates/tasks.md
- Existing SKILL patterns in skills/delegation-principle/ and skills/communication-style/
- Goal detection is regex-based heuristics
- VF task follows existing [VERIFY] pattern
- Goal detection added after "When Invoked" with Step 1 (classify) and Step 2 (diagnose for fix goals)
- VF generation logic added to task-planner: detect Reality Check (BEFORE) in .progress.md, insert VF task after 4.2
- qa-engineer now handles VF tasks: reads BEFORE from .progress.md, re-runs command, compares BEFORE/AFTER, documents Reality Check (AFTER)

### Verification: 1.3 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint
- Status: PASS
- Checks: file existence verified
  - SKILL.md: exists (104 lines, ASCII text)
  - plan-synthesizer.md: exists (535 lines, ASCII text)
- Result: Both files valid markdown

### Verification: 2.3 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint
- Status: PASS
- All 5 target files exist and contain verification content:
  - skills/reality-verification/SKILL.md: exists (9 verification matches)
  - agents/plan-synthesizer.md: exists (15 verification matches)
  - agents/task-planner.md: exists (70 verification matches)
  - agents/qa-engineer.md: exists (55 verification matches)
  - templates/tasks.md: exists (25 verification matches)
