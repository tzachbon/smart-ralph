- [x] 1.5 POC Checkpoint - 010e43b

## Current Task

Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- Quick mode synthesis from plan file
- 5 files to modify: SKILL.md (create), plan-synthesizer.md, task-planner.md, qa-engineer.md, templates/tasks.md
- Existing SKILL patterns in skills/delegation-principle/ and skills/communication-style/
- Goal detection is regex-based heuristics
- VF task follows existing [VERIFY] pattern
- Goal detection added after "When Invoked" with Step 1 (classify) and Step 2 (diagnose for fix goals)

### Verification: 1.3 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint
- Status: PASS
- Checks: file existence verified
  - SKILL.md: exists (104 lines, ASCII text)
  - plan-synthesizer.md: exists (535 lines, ASCII text)
- Result: Both files valid markdown
