# Progress: enforce-teams-instead

## Original Goal
Enforce in Claude Code all phases to use teams instead of sub agents if possible.

## Status
- Phase: Phase 1 - POC
- Started: 2026-02-19

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Convert research.md to team-based pattern
- [x] 1.2 Add team lifecycle to requirements.md
- [x] 1.3 Add team lifecycle to design.md

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- start.md already implements full team lifecycle for research (sections 11a-11h) -- this is the reference pattern
- research.md uses multi-Task parallelism (multiple Task calls in one message) which is functionally parallel but lacks team coordination infrastructure
- requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md each use a single Task(subagent_type: ...) call -- teams add consistency but no parallelism gain
- implement.md has [P] parallel task support via multi-Task calls, and a stop-hook loop that must NOT be replaced
- Sequential execution tasks in implement.md should NOT use teams -- overhead per loop iteration is unacceptable
- Team naming convention `$phase-$spec` prevents collisions when multiple phases run or when debugging orphaned teams
- Orphaned team cleanup is critical because session interruptions can leave teams behind
- Feedback loops (review -> re-invoke agent) need team lifecycle consideration: cleanup-and-recreate is simpler than reusing teams
- design.md allowed-tools changed from restricted list to "*" to support team tools (same pattern as research.md and requirements.md)
- requirements.md allowed-tools changed from restricted list to "*" to support team tools (same pattern as research.md)
- All changes are markdown-only; no compilation or build step required
- Plugin version bump is mandatory per CLAUDE.md for any plugin file change
- research.md allowed-tools changed from restricted list to "*" to support team tools (TeamCreate, TaskCreate, TaskList, SendMessage, TeamDelete)

## Next
Task 1.4: Add team lifecycle to tasks.md command
